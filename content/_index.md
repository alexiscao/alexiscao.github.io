I am doing research in the [ARC](https://arc.isi.jhu.edu/) group at Johns Hopkins University under the advising of Professor [Matthew Green](https://matthewgreen.io). My research interests are in cryptography and anonymous communication networks.

I visited the [COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/) group at KU Leuven as a research intern from July to September 2025 where I worked on improving the security and privacy of mixnets under the supervision of Professor [Claudia Diaz](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~cdiaz/). 

I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University in May 2025.

Outside of research, I love doing jiujitsu when I have time and I am currently a blue belt.
